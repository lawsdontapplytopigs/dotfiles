* if you want to get the font height you can use the `beautiful` module for that.
    The function is `beautiful.get_font_height(font)`.

* to use the X11 clipboard inside the awesome window manager, you have to use its c api.
    So to display as a notification what you currently have in your clipboard you can do:
    ```lua
    local naughty = require("naughty")
    local capi = { selection }

    naughty.notify({text = tostring(capi.selection())})
    ```
    !!! NOTE: apparently you can't use that code to do that. 
    But I know making it work still has to do with that piece of the c api.
    When I tried that code and restarted awesome, it just showed everything blank.
    Or at least that was the case in the `Xephyr` utility.

* apparently, the radical package that Elv wrote uses the `radical.object` module
    to make the '''object''', whatever that means. I'm guessing that it's just the
    basic setup of a general object he's trying to use. So from this general structure
    then maybe he wants to set it up afterwards. In all the widgets he's created.

* UNDOCUMMENTED! The `wibox.container.background` widget also takes an undocummented
    parameter: `spacing`, which, of course, just tells the widget how much spacing
    to put between widgets

* UNDOCUMMENTED! (or if it is, it's buried somewhere deep down in the docs),
    but you can add spacing to widgets, and ALSO you can add an aditional property
    `spacing_widget` where you can construct a whole another widget, inline.

* ITEMS IN RADICAL: it seems items in the `radical system are first and foremost
    made in the `radical/item/init.lua` file. I think this handles the color
    changing, the selection, automatic redrawing, etc.
* For really customizing titlebars, I'll have to look at this:
